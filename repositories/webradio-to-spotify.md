As a big fan of Classic Rock living in France, I am very frustrated by the
lack of good classic rock radio we have. I spent four months in St Louis, MO,
and I had the chance to listen to [KSHE 95](http://www.kshe95.com/) every day,
playing some of my favorite classic rock tunes.
Unfortunately, I can't listen to this radio in France as they block it.
Fortunately, their website shows the tune currently playing, as well
as a few previous ones.

I decided to make myself an empty
[Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/ericda/playlist/3BCcE8T945z1MnfPWkFsfX),
and automatically add in the KSHE tracks.
I also wanted to be able to add songs
from other similar Classic Rock radio. So I built a reusable architecture that
enables to register different web scrapers to get the radio playing history
and add that into my playlist.

So far, I am able to get the songs from these radios:

- [KSHE95 (St Louis, MO)](https://www.kshe95.com/)
- [The Eagle 969 (Sacramento, CA)](https://eagle969.radio.com/)
- [Q104.3 (New York, NY)](https://q1043.iheart.com/)

Feel free to ping me if you want to help!

## Installation

To make it work, here's what to do.

First, you'll need to setup your Spotify developer account, and register an app.
Find how [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).
Once your app is created, you will have access to the following crendentials:

- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `redirect_uri`

Find you `user_id` (your spotify username) and add these 4 credentials in a file called `.spotify-token.json`. You have a template here: [.spotify-token.json.dist](./.spotify-token.json.dist). The app will need those to update tracks to your playlist.

Once you're good, install the requirements in a virtual environment:

``` shell
pip install virtualenv  # if you don't have it already
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The app uses an `sqlite` database to store all the songs it has downloaded so
far. You have to initialize the database running this command: `make init-db`.

Here are the required steps to update your playlist with
the latest songs from the KSHE radio:

- First, launch the server: `make start-api`. The app should now be running \
  on `http://localhost:9999`.
- Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:9999/auth` \
  to authenticate to Spotify.
- Finally, run `make update-playlist` to get the latest songs in your playlist.

## API

The calls supported so far are:

- `GET`, `localhost:9999/api`: Check that the API is up
- `GET`, `localhost:9999/auth`: Authenticate for 3600 seconds
- `GET`, `localhost:9999/api/update_playlist`: Updates the playlist with \
  the latest songs

### Writing your own scraper

If you want to add another website to populate the playlist, you can write
a new scrapper in the [src.scraping](./src/scraping.py) module.

Please follow these steps to do so:

- Create a class whose names ends with `Scraper`, e.g: `YourScrapper`\
    (although it should be explicit which website it crawls).
- Make that class inherit from `Scraper`
- Call for `super()` in its constructor, and pass it the URL of the webpage\
    to crawl and the `playlist_id` to upload the songs to. e.g:

    ```python
    player_url = 'https://radio.com/awesome-song-history'
    playlist_id = '3BCcE8T945z1MnfPWkFsfX'
    super(YourScrapper, self).__init__(player_url, playlist_id)
    ```

- Overide the `get_song_history` method, the first row should be:

    ```python
    soup, driver = self.scrap_webpage()
    ```

- Add your scraper in the [tests](./tests/test_scraping.py) folder:

    ```python
    class TestYourScraper(GenericScraperTest):
        scraper = scraping.YourScraper()
    ```

- Add your scraper in the
  [src.playlist_updater.Updater](./src/playlist_updater.py) class:

    ```python
    self.scrapers = [
        scraping.KSHEScraper(),
        scraping.EagleScraper(),
        scraping.YourScraper()  # New scraper!
    ]
    ```

- You're all set!
